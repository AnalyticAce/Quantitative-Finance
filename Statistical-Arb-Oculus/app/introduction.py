    st.subheader('1. Correlation')
    st.write('Correlation measures the degree to which two assets move in relation to each other.')

    st.subheader('2. Co-integration')
    st.write('Co-integration is a stronger form of relationship between two assets, implying that the spread between them is stationary.')

    st.subheader('3. Stationarity')
    st.write('A time series is stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time.')

    st.subheader('4. Hurst Exponent')
    st.write('The Hurst exponent measures the persistence of a time series.')

    st.subheader('5. Half-Life')
    st.write('The half-life represents the time it takes for the spread between two assets to revert to half of its deviation from the mean.')

    st.subheader('6. Z-Score')
    st.write('The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.')

    st.subheader('7. Spread')
    st.write('The spread is the price difference between the two assets in a pair.')

    st.subheader('8. Hedge Ratio')
    st.write('The hedge ratio determines the number of units of each asset to hold in a pair trading strategy.')
