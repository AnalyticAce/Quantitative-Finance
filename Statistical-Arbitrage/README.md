## Project Goals

Statistical arbitrage, also known as stat arb, is a popular trading strategy that relies on the use of quantitative analysis and statistical models to identify mispricings in related assets. The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Identify Arbitrage Opportunities**: Develop algorithms that can detect potential arbitrage opportunities by analyzing historical market data.

2. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations to present arbitrage opportunities, asset relationships, and trade recommendations in a user-friendly manner.

3. **Data Analysis**: Provide tools for in-depth data analysis, including correlation analysis, cointegration analysis, and volatility assessment.

4. **Risk Management**: Implement risk management techniques and tools to assess and mitigate risks associated with arbitrage trades.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the tool easily, explore opportunities, and customize their trading strategies.
